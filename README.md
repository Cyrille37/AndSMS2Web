# AndSMS2Web

A simple Android SMS to Web gateway.

Targeted for at least Android 2.3.3 (API 10) to permit the use of old phones.

It catch all arrived SMS and put then onto the web. If the request successed messages are not delivered to Incoming Android stuff. They are in case of error.

I do this code to work with [MessageWebGateway](https://github.com/Cyrille37/MessageWebGateway) and by extention with [BotQ](https://github.com/TheCitizenCrew/BotQ).
